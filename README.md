# Md Shihab Uddin,
I'm Md Shihab Uddin from Bangladesh and currently working as staff data engineer in Pathao, Dhaka. Also I've experience to build data driven backend services that are ensuring better customer experience. I believe in ability to solve problem rather than focusing on technology. Language or technology are just a tool to address business problem. 
I work to build robust data infrastructure so that all the services run smoothly . I'm experienced to build and maintain data pipeline system using cutting edge technologies. Having deep understanding on different ecosystems including JVM based languages, Spark, apache beam, Hadoop and Nosql, I contribute to process terabytes of data in batch and millions of rows in streaming. I've broad experience in big data technology for data processing and machine learning algorithm for training model with effective features to boost up the business. Everyday I align with Agile process to deliver high performance application timely. I love to embrace new challenges and extend my knowledge by learning new technology.
